# RandomFood

## What?
This is a React front end application which helps indesicive diners find a place to eat. The goal is to reduce the strain of option overload by asking simple questions culminating in a restaurant and an option to re-roll. Check out this [short demo video](https://youtu.be/4Sw1_z2xyjc)

## Why?
This is my final project for Flatirons School.
It's also a project I personally use with relative frequency. How often have you, either alone or as part of a group, agonized over dining options? Next time you do, try using this. A live version is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://jessenreynolds.github.io/RandomFoodClient/). 

## How?
This repo requires a backend, there is a live version hosted on Heroku. You can view or download the code for the backend on githuib at https://github.com/JesseNReynolds/RandomFoodapi.
